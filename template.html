      <h2 class="subheader"><em>Welcome to Asharaye!</em></h2>

      <p>
        I am so excited that you found this page.
        <em>My name is Mistre Aderaw.</em> I am passionate about personal
        development because I believe
        <strong
          >life is a continuous learning process, and we are all works in
          progress.</strong
        >
        <em>We are like a painting </em>that always needs one more brushstroke
        or like a statue that needs a little more carving and contouring.
        However, in this case, we are the art and the artist, the painter, and
        the canvas, simultaneously the sculptor and the statue. We create our
        own reality through our thoughts, beliefs, and actions. That is why I
        believe in being a student of life and creating a community of
        like-minded individuals so that we can empower, uplift, and inspire each
        other
      </p>
      <p>
        This website aims to spread unifying words, uplifting messages, and
        motivating stories, and the poetry adds a little bit of beauty by
        celebrating positive qualities and aesthetic expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>My mission</em> is to help myself and others tap into our fullest
        potential in order to live our lives in solemn and joyous fulfillment of
        our intended purposes here on <i>Earth</i>. Every change we want to see
        in the world starts within us. Deep inside, we all strive to evolve to
        our most authentic self, and it is inspiring to know that there are many
        others on a similar path. It is my hope and belief that this website can
        serve as a platform to share ideas.
      </p>
